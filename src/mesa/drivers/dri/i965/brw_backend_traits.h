/** \file
 *
 * This file provides traits classes that provide details about the two i965
 * back-ends (the vec4 and the fs backends).  These classes are meant to be
 * used as template parameters so that an algorithm can be generalized to work
 * with both backends.
 *
 * Each trait class provides the following typedefs:
 *
 * - trait::src_reg is the type of the object that represents source
 *   registers.
 *
 * - trait::dst_reg is the type of the object that represents destination
 *   registers.
 *
 * - trait::visitor is the type of the backend visitor class.
