/**
 * \file lower_varying_struct.cpp
 *
 * This lowering pass replaces a varying whose type is a struct (or an array
 * of structs) with equivalent varyings representing the structure elements,
 * and modifies code that refers to the structs to refer to the new varyings
 * instead.
 *
 * For example, the following shader:
 *
 *   struct Foo
 *   {
 *     float x;
 *     float y[3];
 *   };
 *   out Foo foo[4];
 *
 *   main()
 *   {
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 * Is rewritten to the equivalent of*:
 *
 *   struct Foo
 *   {
 *     float x;
 *     float y[3];
 *   };
 *   Foo foo[4];
 *   out float foo_x[4];
 *   out float foo_y[12];
 *
 *   main()
 *   {
 *     ...
 *     for (uint i = 0; i < 4u; i++) {
 *       foo_x[i] = foo[i].x;
 *       for (uint j = 0; j < 3u; j++) {
 *         foo_y[i * 3 + j] = foo[i].y[j];
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * *The actual GLSL IR generated is slightly more verbose than this in order
 * to avoid complicating the algorithm.  But it is equivalent after
 * optimization.
 *
 * Note that in the case where there is an array of structs, and the struct
 * itself contains an array, the lowered varying is a flat array rather than
 * an array of arrays.  Rationale: arrays of arrays are prohibited in GLSL, so
 * some back-ends may not implement them properly.  Also, varying packing code
 * assumes arrays are one-dimensional.
